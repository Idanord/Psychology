    <h2>Consciousness</h2>
        <p>What is Consiousness? This is our awarness of our cognitive processes that we have in our lifes on a daily basis. These processes are tied closely into how we send signals and create thoughts. Meaning that we are able to be aware of good choices and bad chioces. As well we are able to dream and help relieve the stress of the day. Dreams are away for us to process the information that was obtained though out the course of the day.</p>
        <p>While we are dreaming we are going though some changes, these include how we heal ourselves. During this time we are in what can be called a restoritive function. It is kind of like doing a virus clean on a computer or creating backups of files from our computers. Though no one really knows exactly why we need to sleep to get into this state to restore ourselves.</p>
        <p>Though that isn't to say people don't have ways to alter thier consciouness. Some people alter their conscious by taking drugs. These types of drugs are from the psychoactive types. Things like anti-depressents are used and have been used for thousands of years. Many were even used during religous reituals.</p>
