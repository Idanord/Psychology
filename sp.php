    <p>We can sense something simply by taking social cues from someone. Or seeing how someone is holding themselves. This would be a way for us as humans to sense and percieve a situation. We can see if someone is not feeling well just by looking at how they are acting. Along with that we may be able to percieve that this person wants to be left alone. That is as simple as senory and perception works hand in hand.</p>
