    <p>A person's thoughts are unto themselves. This is a simple way to look at personality. Each person has their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that create who they are. What type of person they are or will be. Some people are more outgoing than others. Each has a way to express themselves. Are there factors that play into one's personality from an outside source or is it all internal as if they were born this way?</p>
    <p>That is a question that is always in debate. No one answer is more correct than another. There are things that are in play on both sides of that question. Take how a person was raised. If they were raised by a God fearing family they mostlikely will have a personality has they grow and get older in that same line of thought as their family. To where they may have had this feeling that is who they are supposed to be when they are born. If you look at a baby and see that they are outgoing as a child they were probably able to express this early on. Though their family may be made up of people who are introverts and as they get older they may start showing that side of themselves more. That would be an external force palying on how internal processes were when they were born.</p>
