    <p>Everyone is faced with stress on a day to day basis. Be it a deadline at work or how things are going at their own home and those relationships with people close to them. If they have had a passing of a familiy member or a new child born. Each of those are some reasons why people would stress. But what can people do to deal(cope) with stress?</p>
    <p>Some people put up "walls" to protect themselves from a stressful situation. Keeping loved ones at an "arms length". Is one way how people deal with stress. Some turn to alcohol, "the bottle", or to drugs to relieve the stress they are under. To where others may seak out help from a theripist. One is more dangurous than finding and getting help for their stress.</p>
    <p>Stress can be a big factor in our health. Take the person that turns to "the bottle". That person could find that they are falling into a habbit of needing a drink every night. While talking to a theripist can be useful to talk to and get an outside perspective on how they are dealing with stress. That can make a person happier or even help get them the type of medical needs to deal with stress.</p>
