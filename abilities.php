<h2 class="pageTitles">Cognition &amp; Mental Abilities</h2>
    <p>Mental abilities are a great part of styding psychology. Everyone has differences in how they handel things. This can be contributied to how people handle things in their own minds. There are several theories about cognition &amp; mental abilites. But what is it exactly?</p>
    <p>To answer that question one needs to understand what the building blocks of thoughts are. It really comes down to a few simple things that humans use to create thoughts. These are language, images, and concepts. Take language for example, we have come up with a system of symbols that help us convey our thoughts to others. Though this is not the only way we are able to convey what we are thinking. We can also show them by images.</p>
    <p>Images help us express our own thoughts and get the point accross. To have the creativity to do so is just one of many mental abilities that we as humans have at our disposal. There is a saying in the world of 'mind over matter'. This saying is a simple way to say anything that humans put their minds to they can achieve anything. I look at a spicific show that shows how people have traind themselfs to overcome obsticals. I speak of 'Stan Lee's Superhumns', this show has been able to show the world that anything a person can put their mind to they can do. Which realates back to the topic of mental abilities to show that our thoughts are only one tool we have to overcome obstiacls in our world.</p>
