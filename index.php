    <p class="overview">My name is Will Fisher, over the past several weeks the class has gotten to know me via the post that I have done in the weekly discussions. I have learned a lot over the course of the past several weeks. Ideas and better understanding are part of what I have learned over the quarter. I have enjoyed the class as our discussions allowed me to speak about some topics that are personal or that I have found interesting.</p>
    <p class="overview">There are several subjects, theories, and ideas that have sparked my interest in the the world of psychology. Just to name a few that sparked my interest are biological behavior, meantal abilities of people, and the psychological disorders. Though out this class I have been able to look into myself and see things that I hadn't previously associated myself with. I feel that this is a very useful class overall. Following the links you will see topics that I have learned over the course of the class.</p>
