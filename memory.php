    <p>How do we obtain and mentain memories? We have daily life experiences that are processed. Some of these are only held on to for a short time and others for a long period of time. Sort-term memory is processed like a computer processes information. This is done in chunks. This is the information that is known as "working" memory to process information that we are currently active attending to. Some of this information will be stored longer but it first has to be processed.</p>
    <p>The information that we store for a long time is stored in the Long-term memory. This type of memory can store a vast amount of information for many years. Sometimes this information can be forgotten. There are factors that can play into humans forgetting information. This can come from an external or internal source. It can be from a head trama that has occured or something that is happening to us on a biological level.</p>
    <p>The theory on how memory is lost over time is called the decay theory. A simple explination is as we get older our memories become harder to pull up from the depths of the storage. Much like if a computer has been on for a long time it would start to have issues when it comes to pulling up and running programs.</p>
