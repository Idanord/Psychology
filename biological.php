        <p>We all have biological processes that help us in our behavior. Though is some of these processes get damaged than we can have problems as we express ourselves. Each person is unique in how they express themselves but each person has the same building blocks for those processes.</p>
        <p>Neurons are the messangers to the rest of the body on how a person is feeling as well as being able to transmit signals to the rest of the body to express how a person is. These messages are sent via the nervous system by synaptic impulses or electrical signals as they are better known to the genral public. This system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, reciving points, and transmition points in the nervous system.</p>
        <p>This system contains the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the endocrine system. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The PNS is made up of two different neurons, this is where signals are sent and recived. The two types of neurons are the afferent and efferent neurons. The afferent neurons send the signals to the CNS, to where the efferent neurons carry signals back to the CNS.</p>
        <p>The endocrine system is our one other communication system in the human body. This system is made up of the endocrine glands, these glands produce hormons for our bodies. The system regulates things like our metabolism and our sleep wake cycle. If these our out of balance our bodies will tell us via these systems.</p>
