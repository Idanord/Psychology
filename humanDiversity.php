        <p>Knowing that humans are as divers as they come is an important concept in psychology. Every city is home to a large group of people that are different in many ways. People have different values that not only span from culture to culter in the large sense of the word. But have different values baised on thier own up bringing.</p>
        <p>A person who is born in the Middle East will have a different outlook on the world than someone who is born in the western socity. That even goes further to where people who live in the same country have differnt views on things. An example of that is with in the United States.</p>
        <p>As the US is one great big melting pot of cultures from around the world. We can see that someone who is born in the south part of the country will have different outlooks than someone born in the north part of the country. As well imigrents bring their own cultures and outlooks to the US when they come here. Even if they are only here for a vacation they bring differnt ways to view things. Families as well have different views.</p>
        <p>One person may be born into a family that dislikes one set of polotics and that will effect them as they grow up. To where someone else will have the opposite view point on polotics. As well these same two people would have different views on how to go about a day to day life. Each person would have a different view on how to raise their own children. These types of things are what makes humans so diverse.</p>
